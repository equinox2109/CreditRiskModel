# CreditRiskProject
Project Description:
This project is part of the data preparation phase for building a credit risk model at a central bank in Europe. The main task involves cleaning and preprocessing a loan dataset, making it ready for further analysis to predict default probabilities.

Data Cleaning:
Convert currency from USD to Euros.
Transform categorical variables into numerical codes.
Handle missing data by assigning worst-case default values based on risk assessment.

Data Transformation:
Create dummy variables for categorical features with binary outcomes.
Split date information into more granular components if necessary.

Save Processed Data:
Once cleaning and transformations are complete, save the cleaned data to a new CSV file.

Documentation:
Maintain a detailed log of all modifications to the dataset in a documentation file. This should include explanations of transformations and rationale for handling missing data.
Final Note:
Ensure all data preprocessing steps align with the analytical goals and compliance standards of the bank. This preparation is crucial for the subsequent stages of model development and will directly impact the effectiveness of the credit risk model.

Next Steps:
After preprocessing, the dataset will be handed over to data scientists for modeling. They will use machine learning techniques to develop a model that predicts the probability of default based on the cleaned data.
